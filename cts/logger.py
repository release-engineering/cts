Logging functions.

At the beginning of the CTS flow, init_logging(conf) must be called.

After that, logging from any module is possible using Python's "logging"
module as showed at
<https://docs.python.org/3/howto/logging.html#logging-basic-tutorial>.

Examples:

import logging

logging.debug("Phasers are set to stun.")
logging.info("%s tried to build something", username)
logging.warn("%s failed to build", task_id)

"""

import logging

levels = {}
levels["debug"] = logging.DEBUG
levels["error"] = logging.ERROR
levels["warning"] = logging.WARNING
levels["info"] = logging.INFO


def str_to_log_level(level):
    """
    Returns internal representation of logging level defined
    by the string `level`.

    Available levels are: debug, info, warning, error
    """
    if level not in levels:
        return logging.NOTSET

    return levels[level]


def init_logging(conf):
    """
    Initializes logging according to configuration file.
    """
    log_format = "%(asctime)s - %(threadName)s - %(name)s - %(levelname)s - %(message)s"

    if conf.log_file:
        logging.basicConfig(
            filename=conf.log_file, level=conf.log_level, format=log_format
        )
        log = logging.getLogger()
    else:
        logging.basicConfig(level=conf.log_level, format=log_format)
        log = logging.getLogger()
        log.setLevel(conf.log_level)
